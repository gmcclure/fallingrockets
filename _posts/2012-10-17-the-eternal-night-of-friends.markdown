I find myself on Facebook frequently depressed, scanning a stack of status
updates and indulging a sense of longing. Sometimes this longing is for the kind
of free-wheeling, spurious socialization that Facebook is, I think, intended
to fulfill. More often it is an indirect-but-intentional side effect, a sort
of emotional welling similar to the sensation induced by spinning in place and
staring at one point in the sky, trying to get at the pleasures of dizziness.

Still, Facebook is nothing if not a great attempt at soul food, social gumbo,
a way of pouring all your human beans into a technological broth meant to be
tasted slowly and continually, but never finally consumed. For me, though,
there's never a second-day savor, when all the ingredients have had a chance
to get close and then get closer. On Facebook, there is no second day, only a
string of successive first days, where the flavors are as distinct and expected
and satisfying as ever they attain to being in their individual merits, spicy
or flat, sweet or confusing, but never able to blend into a carefully seasoned
curry. All Facebook status updates, by virtue of their endlessly equal march
regardless of content, jostle each other in a manner that's neither congenial
nor rude, but perfectly homogeneous in their exclusivity, as though we're all
suspended in the broth's bubbles. As though we are a broth of bubbles.

Any given day, a friend -- "friend," as a reference on Facebook, is a
smooth-turning knob with stops at Total Stranger and Actual Friend, and where
any setting to the left of maximum implies a degree of personal spin, making
Facebook, at times, a very performative space. One friend might post about
her terrible day while another blurbs his involvement with an ongoing and
controversial political movement. Someone else will add to his long list of
affirmations, which makes me wonder if he's struggling, and then a long-silent
acquaintance might pop up and scrawl a quote, newly meaningful to him -- "We are
all a lost generation" -- but often with no explanation as to how or why it's
meaningful. Novelty is the necessary conclusion. Or sometimes there is a quick
explanation, but Facebook is insufficient to any touch but the lightest. The
Facebook flowchart of responses allows for only a few pathways: 1) mysterious
brevity, 2) dry humor, 3) zany humor, 4) witty humor, or 5) inappropriate humor.
It's a jackpot when a response hits all five numbers at once.

This is, by the way, entirely an account of self-implication. I admit that
I'm guiltier than any of my friends when it comes to putting on a Faceface.
I'm forever chasing Facewit, Googling other people's Facequotes, responding
as if I've known the origin for time out of mind, and, generally, trying to
sell others on my Facebrain, which bears only an incidental resemblance to the
slower, technologically unassisted gray mass.

So for me Facebook is frequently a bummer place, despite being a place for
friends -- "Friends" probably the apt gross reference to the collection of
amicable relationships found there, but also as a reference to the TV show that
mimics Facebook's strange, planar desolation. Always content to zone out to a
familiar melody, it was years before I realized just how weird "Friends" is as
a story. Every season, the plots and characters are almost exactly the same.
(Perhaps, though, there's some truth in that.) Ross wants Rachel, but can't have
her. Sometimes it's the reverse, Rachel wanting Ross, and that's a nice change.
Chandler is always witty and fumbling. Sometimes he isn't quite as fumbling --
cool when that happens. Ross is fumbling and charmingly witless, but he has a
Ph.D. in paleontology, which no one ever wants to hear about even though they're
all close friends and this is his life's work. Joey, too, fumbling, and with a
sexual power that is never convincingly established, but the audience is meant
to buy it, even when Matt LeBlanc is on the Doughnut Diet, so fine, I like
dougnuts too, and sex -- there's a Category 5 joke there somewhere. Phoebe's
idiocy always resolves into spacey wisdom and Monica's relentlessly anal drives
are always mitigated because she can cook. The show is perfectly flat. Nothing
is really emphasized -- other than the idea that friends matter -- or is allowed
to gain much traction. But everyone's so pretty. Nothing is ever established, or
asserted. There is wordplay.

And, yes, I *get* it, it's a *sit-com*, so the joke's on me if I take it too
seriously, but that's just the thing -- I really do *like* Friends. I will
watch Friends if it's on. I'll even get excited if I catch the first show in
its hour-long, late-night, two-season syndication. I've seen all the episodes,
I know the jokes, I know the characters. But if it's on, I'll watch it, because
these people are the ultimate others, with problems I don't understand because
they're not actually problems, like a meal of human chips, salty and tasty, but
not really food. Perfect, though, for convenient, relentless consumption.

As is Facebook -- it's the way to eat your friends as salty, bite-sized chips.
And I don't pretend that Facebook seriously interrupts or interferes with the
meaningful relationships of my life, because it doesn't. But if you're prone to
ennui or the mild spiritual malaise that comes with, well, living, Facebook can
be a technological pharmakon, killing while it cures in a trade-off that's very
nearly equal, but not exactly quite. The argument might be made that Facebook
does nothing, that it merely mirrors what's happening within, but that ignores
the significance of form. When I'm not on Facebook I don't think about my
friends in terms of a collection of brief, running notes, nor do I spend time
trying to invent ways to present myself in that format. Meeting friends is not,
generally, a drive-by experience that emphasizes rapid-fire cleverness. For now,
on Facebook, this is always the case.
